# Guipoker.py

The code makes sense and the graphical user interface works.

When playing the game the dice are able to be changed after a roll and then the score comes up
seamlessly.

It may be a bit difficult to read for someone that doesn't understand the graphics module,
but there is a textbook that can help out with that.

The color of the interface is also nice and different.

# pokerapp.py

pokerapp has been succesfully imported into guipoker so its functionality does work.

The lines of code are easy to read and make sense in terms of their functionality.

# roller.py

The imports from random, graphics, button.py, and dieview.py all work.

The buttons rolle dice and quit do their job

# button.py

The code works because when it is imported into guipoker its functionality work.

The graphics module does what it needs to

Just like guipoker, for someone without an understanding of the graphics module
it may be difficult for them to understand some of the code.
